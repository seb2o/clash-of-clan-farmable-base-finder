Works with the desktop version of Google Play. Basically uses your mouse on your behalf, using OCR to decide which action to take.  
Screen dimensions are 1920*1080, for another resolution, adapt magic numbers in ```extract```, ```grab_ressources```, ```next_village```, ```launch_attack```.  
Launch script, then you have ```2``` seconds (magic number) to bring the clash of clan window on top. Then wait for a loud beep which 
will announce a valuable (definition of valuable is in ```enough_ressources```) village has been found.   
If you ever find this and decide to use it/ improve it, I would be curious to see the 
result.
